# Business Information System Design & Development Coursework

## Part 1
> PHP OOP File for Auctioning

> You start a new electronic site through which people can auction items they do not want any more. Items auctioned through your site are: pieces of furniture, books and paintings. Users who are interested, can see the current bid and place a new bid. For each item, the following details should be known by the system:

* Unique id number
* The name of the person who sells it (seller),
* The type of the item (furniture, book or painting),
* A brief description,
* The price the seller asks (starting price),
* The last day people can make bids (closing date)
* Current bid

## Part 2
> PHP OOP Application Structure with Database Access for the **'Online Academy'**

> Part B is based on the ‘Online Academy’ scenario we used during semester 1. For the needs of this coursework, we will refer only to one actor: the tutor. In order to offer tutorials through ‘Online Academy’ site, tutors must provide the following information: name, email, phone number, qualifications, subjects to teach and rates per hour. Using object oriented PHP and MySQL, you should create a web site that will allow users/administrators to browse for the tutors who offer tutorials for ‘Online Academy’ and take some actions. In details, you should perform the following tasks:

### Part 2: Tasks
* Present all tutors on the screen - `public/our_tutors.php`
* Get full details for a specific tutor - `public/view.php`
* Add, Delete, Edit - `public/add.php`, `public/delete.php`
* Optimize code using `$database` class - `private/class_database.php`
